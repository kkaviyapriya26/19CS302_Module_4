# EX 19 C program to perform basic left and right shift operations on a given integer and display the result.
## DATE: 29-04-25
## AIM:
To write a C program to perform basic left and right shift operations on a given integer and display the result.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Define the required variable.
3. Write program to find frequency of a character.
4. Read the value using scanf.
5. Ask the user to make an input.
6. Print out the answer.
7. End.    

## Program:
```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
int i,count=0,len;
char str[100],val[100];
scanf("%s %s",str,val);
len=strlen(str);
for(i=0;i<len;i++){
if(str[i]==val[0])
count++;
}printf("%d",count);}
```

## Output:
